# Titanic_survivor_predictor
An XGBoost scikit learn Decision tree model to predict whether a person survived the titanic or not. Implemented using a custom ML pipeline using scikit learns Pipeline class and custom transformer classes for data preprocessing.

Data preprocessing techniques such as One Hot encoding, feature scaling with z normalization, and Imputations have been utilized along with other techniques after performing simple EDA on the data.
